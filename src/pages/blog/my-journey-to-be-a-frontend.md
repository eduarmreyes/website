## My first job

I started working at a company called Telus International in El Salvador, I was
able to contribute to at least 50 web applications from small to larger ones.
For me, it was basically the school before school, you know? I was a Software
Engineer developing web applications using PHP, HTML, JavaScript and CSS. Back
in the day we would not need to use compilers for our JavaScript or CSS, we
actually was using a lot of jQuery, and Symfony (a PHP framework).

At the time, I did not know I would have been attracted to create websites and
work in the web. When I was studying to be a Software Engineer, the path was not
clear to me, but thank to that first job, I realized I liked to handle data and
paint it in the screen and make it look nice.

The very first thing I remember doing to make a web application look better was
to use [select2](https://select2.org/dropdown) to make dropdowns have way much
better user experience.
