          . A nice country with a lot of good things in a tiny amount of earth.
          It's so tiny that you're able to be at the beach in the morning and
          have a great old town tour at the afternoon, you could even go to a
          nice mall at night and be back to your place all in one day.

          I decided to be a Software Developer because I like the idea to create
          nice things to make life easier to others, I also was impacted when I
          realized I could be really good at this just by having a laptop and
          internet, the fact that a boy from El Salvador can compite with people
          that was upbrought in a country with different opportunities gave me
          hope my future was as bright as my imagination.

          Fun fact about me, I am a former shortstop baseball player, I even
          played representing my country for a couple of years, wonderful,
          amazing, fill with beautiful memories.
